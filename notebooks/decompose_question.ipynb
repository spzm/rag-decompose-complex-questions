      "The Party for Freedom (Partij voor de Vrijheid; PVV) in the Netherlands is known primarily for promoting anti-immigration and anti-Islamic policies. The PVV, led by Geert Wilders, is an anti-Islam populist party that draws on support from the now defunct List Pim Fortuyn (LPF), which was named after its founder Wilhelmus Fortuyn, who was also an anti-immigration populist and was assassinated in 2002. The PVV has also been quick to capitalize on populist sentiment, particularly in the wake of the euro-zone debt crisis.
